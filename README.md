# shopping-cart-with-node
In this repository i will be sharing the files of a shopping cart using node js 

Here i made two HTML files namely login.html and register.html so that any user can first register themself and login to the main shopping cart

The brief idea of register is to see wether a user exists or not , if not then we need to create a user and creates a table in mongodb which stores the things bought by the user and keep his status to be not active... when he logins the status becomes active and will be directed to the shopping cart and keeps the status to be not active when he sign out.

If a user buys any item then that will be added to his table and is displayed in the my cart table.

ENJOY CODDING ...........
